Web Development(MERN)
#1. Frontend(html,css,js,reactjs)
#2. Backend (server(APIs),Database)
APIs stands for application programming interface.setup of code help to make the communication.
Database ia aplace where we are storing the data.--for mongodb --cloud database
 here,
 M-MongoDb
 e-APIs/server
 r-react
 n-node

node --javascript runtime environment
it has engine of v8 ..similar google chrome do have.
it is a compiler or interpretar  which execute javascript..code outside my browser also.

javascript firstly for frontend only now for backend also.
rest APIs--removing deleting the data with single APIs.

## packages under nodemon

##### js #######

-1.node .js is a run time environment that allows you to run js on the server side,outside of a browser.it uses the v8 js engine(the one that powers google chrome),enabling js to perform backend operations like reading files,handlingrequests,interacting with  databases,etc,.
-2.non-blocking I/O:node .js uses an event -driven,non-blocking architecture,which makes it ideal for building scalable network applications.
-3.Single-threaded:Node js uses a single thread to handle multiple requests concurrently by using asynchronous programming.
-4.Modules:Node .js uses the commonjs module system to import and export code between files.

### HTTP ###
-1. HTTP (HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL)is the foundation of any data exchange on the web and a key concept when working with express.js,a web framework for node.js.in express you will often deal with requests and responses that conform to the HTTP protocol.

-2.Http methods
* GET:retrieve information.
* post:submit data to be processed.
* put:update a resource.
* delete:remove a resource.
* patch:partially update a resource.
